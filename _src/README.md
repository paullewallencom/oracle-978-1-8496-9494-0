# Oracle Coherence Quickstart [Video]
This is the code repository for [Oracle Coherence Quickstart [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/oracle-coherence-quickstart-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Oracle Coherence is an in-memory distributed data grid solution for clustered applications and application servers. It enables you to build more reliable and scalable data driven applications, by removing any single points of failure and database server access bottlenecks.

This course explores how you can build memory data grid applications with quick and easy steps in just a few minutes. These step-by-step videos will allow you to watch and learn just how simple it is to scale mission-critical applications and provide fast and reliable access to frequently used data.

This course covers everything that you’ll need to know to develop, manage, deploy, and monitor Coherence applications with ease.

Beginning with installation and application development in Eclipse, we'll then go over topics such as cache functions for your servers, using Coherence facets, and monitoring applications with JMX. We'll also discuss different cache topologies and what sets them apart. We'll then wrap up with an overview of the Coherence API’s extensive features, as well as using the Coherence*Extend client.
